 6 degrees Fahrenheit (0.9 degrees Celsius) since 1906.                |
| Impacts of global warming are evident now         | The effects of global warming, such as melting glaciers and sea ice, shifting precipitation patterns, and changes in animal migration, are observable in the present.                                 |
| Climate change encompasses various shifts         | Climate change refers to a range of complex shifts in weather and climate systems, including extreme weather events, changing wildlife populations and habitats, rising sea levels, and other impacts. |
| Human activities contribute to climate change     | The addition of heat-trapping greenhouse gases to the atmosphere by humans has led to climate change.                                  |
| Accelerated ice loss in Antarctica                | Climate change has caused a faster rate of ice loss across the continent of Antarctica 

Here is the expert summary of the article along with key points relevant to climate change policy makers:
